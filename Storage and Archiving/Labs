Amazon EBS Lab: Volume Management and Snapshots

Overview 
This lab demonstrates how to use Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) with EC2 instances to 
provide scalable, high-performance block storage. You learned how to create, attach, 
mount, snapshot, and restore EBS volumes. 

Architecture Workflow: 
1. Create a new EBS volume. 
2. Attach the volume to an EC2 instance. 
3. Format and mount the volume on the instance. 
4. Create a snapshot of the volume. 
5. Restore a new volume from the snapshot and reattach it to the instance. 

Objectives 
By the end of this lab, you can: 
• Create an EBS volume. 
• Attach and mount an EBS volume to an EC2 instance. 
• Create a snapshot of an EBS volume. 
• Restore an EBS volume from a snapshot. 

Steps Taken 
Task 1 — Creating a New EBS Volume 
• Created a 1 GiB General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume in the same Availability Zone as 
the EC2 instance (us-west-2a). 
• Added a tag: Name = My Volume. 

Task 2 — Attaching the Volume 
• Attached My Volume to the EC2 instance using device /dev/sdb. 
• Verified volume status: In-use. 

Task 3 — Connecting to the EC2 Instance 
• Used EC2 Instance Connect to open a terminal session on the instance. 

Task 4 — Creating and Configuring the File System 
• Created an ext3 filesystem: 
       Sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb 
• Created mount point and mounted the volume: - 
       Sudo mkdir /mnt/data-store - 
       Sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/data-store 
• Configured auto-mount on reboot via /etc/fstab. 
• Verified mount using df -h. 
• Created a test file and verified: - 
      Sudo sh -c “echo some text has been written > /mnt/data-store/file.txt” - 
      Cat /mnt/data-store/file.txt 

Task 5 — Creating an EBS Snapshot 
• Created a snapshot of My Volume and named it My Snapshot. 
• Snapshots stored in S3 for durability. 
• Deleted the test file on the volume to simulate data loss. 

Task 6 — Restoring the Snapshot 
1. Create a new volume from the snapshot: - 
       Name: Restored Volume - 
       Same Availability Zone. 
2. Attach restored volume to EC2 instance as /dev/sdc. 
3. Mount restored volume: - 
       Sudo mkdir /mnt/data-store2 - 
       Sudo mount /dev/sdc /mnt/data-store2 
4. Verified restored file exists: - 
       Ls /mnt/data-store2/file.txt 

✅ Results 
• Successfully created and attached EBS volumes. 
• Mounted volumes with a persistent configuration (fstab). 
• Took a snapshot and restored a new volume from it. 
• Verified data restoration and file integrity. 

�
� Key Takeaways 
• EBS volumes are block-level storage that can be attached to EC2 instances. 
• Snapshots provide durable backups and can be restored as new volumes. 
• Proper mounting and fstab configuration ensures volumes persist across reboots. 
• EBS snapshots store only used blocks, saving storage space.
