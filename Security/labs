AWS Cloud Monitoring Lab: Monitor an EC2 Instance

 Overview:
 This project demonstrates how to log, monitor, and alert on EC2 instance
 performance using Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon SNS. The goal was to create an
 automated monitoring setup that sends an email alert when the EC2 instance exceeds a
 specific CPU utilization threshold, then visualize the data in a CloudWatch dashboard.
 
Task 1: Configure Amazon SNS
 1 Opened the AWS Management Console and navigated to Simple Notification Service
 (SNS).
 2 Created a new SNS topic named MyCwAlarm with type set to Standard.
 3 Added a subscription to the topic using my email address and confirmed the
 subscription through the verification email from AWS.
 4 Verified that the subscription status changed from Pending confirmation to Confirmed.
 Outcome: Successfully created an SNS topic to send email notifications for CloudWatch
 alarms.
 
Task 2: Create a CloudWatch Alarm
 1 Opened CloudWatch from the AWS Console.
 2 Navigated to Metrics → EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics and selected the CPUUtilization
 metric for the Stress Test EC2 instance.
 3 Created a new alarm named LabCPUUtilizationAlarm with threshold > 60%, period 1
 minute, and average statistic.
 4 Configured the alarm to send a notification to the MyCwAlarm SNS topic when In
 alarm.
 5 Reviewed and created the alarm.
 Outcome: Set up a CloudWatch alarm that triggers an SNS email alert when CPU usage
 exceeds 60%.

Task 3: Test the CloudWatch Alarm
 1 Accessed the Stress Test EC2 instance via AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
 or instance URL.
 2 Ran 'sudo stress --cpu 10 -v --timeout 400s' to simulate high CPU load.
 3 Opened a second terminal and ran 'top' to monitor live CPU usage.
 4 Refreshed the CloudWatch alarm page every minute until the alarm status changed to
 In alarm.
 5 Checked email inbox and confirmed receipt of AWS Notification email triggered by
 SNS topic.
 Outcome: Successfully tested and verified that the alarm triggers and sends an email alert
 when CPU usage exceeds the set threshold.

Task 4: Create a CloudWatch Dashboard
 1 In CloudWatch, navigated to Dashboards → Create dashboard.
 2 Named the dashboard LabEC2Dashboard.
 3 Added a Line widget using the CPUUtilization metric for the Stress Test EC2 instance.
 4 Saved the dashboard.
 Outcome: Created a CloudWatch dashboard to visualize the EC2 instance’s CPU
 utilization in real time.

Summary of Achievements
 1 Created an SNS topic and confirmed an email subscription.
 2 Configured a CloudWatch alarm for CPU utilization > 60%.
 3 Stress tested the EC2 instance to simulate high CPU load.
 4 Verified that the SNS email alert was successfully sent.
 5 Built a CloudWatch dashboard to monitor EC2 performance metrics.

Tools and Services Used
 1 Amazon EC2 – Compute instance for stress testing
 2 Amazon CloudWatch – Monitoring, alarms, and dashboards
 3 Amazon SNS – Notification service for alerts
 4 AWS Systems Manager Session Manager – Secure EC2 access

Key Takeaway
 This project demonstrates the integration between CloudWatch and SNS to create a
 proactive monitoring solution for EC2 instances. By setting up alarms, alerts, and
 dashboards, I gained hands-on experience with AWS monitoring tools to ensure visibility,
 performance tracking, and timely response to system anomalies
